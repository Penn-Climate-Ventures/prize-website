We believe in the immense potential of climate tech startups, and want to help students get their ideas off the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Eligibility</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Who can apply?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All students enrolled at a university or high school in the world are eligible to compete. All core members of the team must be current students. The PCV Prize team reserves the right to determine a team’s eligibility.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Does every member of my startup’s team need to be a student?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nope! It’s perfectly fine if you have non-students in your startup. However, only students are allowed to compete in the PCV Prize. Furthermore, if you are an incorporated startup, at least one of the students presenting must be an owner / managing member listed in the articles of incorporation. We’re focused on students, so no interns presenting for established startups :).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can I apply without prior experience with tech or startups?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We strongly encourage anyone interested in the PCV Prize or climate innovation to apply. There are no requirements for what a successful PCV Prize team will look like, and we will be hosting educational events to help teams build and strengthen their startup ideas.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>What type of solution should I present?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anywhere from just an idea to a working prototype. The key caveat is that teams must have less than 25K in external funding. As much as we would love to support great climate startups that are already growing, we’re focused on encouraging new students to enter the scene.
