## Eligibility

<details>
    <summary>What if I don't have a team?</summary>
    No worries! We're holding a team formation event directly after our opening keynote. Make sure to register as an individual if you are interested in finding a team through this event. Students do not have to be US citizens and non-Penn students do not need to be studying at US colleges or universities.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>I'm working on a startup, but some team members have already graduated. Does every member of my startup’s team need to be a student?</summary>
    Nope! It’s perfectly fine if you have non-students in your startup. However, only students are allowed to compete in the PCV Prize, so only they can register and pitch.
    <br/>
    Furthermore, if you are an incorporated startup, at least one of the students presenting must be an owner / managing member listed in the articles of incorporation. No interns presenting for established companies :).
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I apply without prior experience with tech or startups?</summary>
    Definitely! We strongly encourage anyone interested in the entrepreneurship or climate action to apply. There are no requirements for what a successful PCV Prize team will look like, and we will be hosting workshops to help teams build and strengthen their startup ideas. 
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What stage should my startup be?</summary>
    Early stage - anywhere from just an idea to a working prototype. Importantly, teams must have less than 15K in external funding. As much as we would love to support great and growing climate startups, we’re focused on encouraging new students to enter the scene.
