# About Us

## We're the generation to solve climate change.
It's no secret that Gen Z and Gen Alpha have to take the reins on the environment. We have the most at stake.

<br/>

We need real innovations and real effort from engineers and business leaders to build the solutions that activists and policymakers can champion. Talent is the bottleneck, and we need you.

## Let's push Penn into Climate.
Imagine a campus where students line up out the doors to work for the biggest movers in climate innovation.

<br/>

Imagine a campus where sustainability and climate analyses are integrated into our course plans, just like basic statistics or calculus.

<br/>

Imagine a campus where climate was just... common sense. 

<br/>

That's what we're building. Come along for the ride.
